# 根 Root
## The Solid.  The Unmoved.  The Entwined.

Root is the concept of maximizing stability.  It is the image of a tree whose roots grow deep and wide into the ground, making it immovable.  Acquiring root is a fundamental challenge for all kung fu practitioners.  It requires a strong foundation in the legs, hips, and core.  It is an exceptionally complicated set of movements to describe, so it is often best to approach it symbolically - visualize the imagery of a tree growing roots.  Conceptualize the strength of the roots.  Sense their growth, feel the energy of your opponent channeled through them.  Believe you are stuck to the ground and unable to move. 

*A defending force trained in advanced maneuvers is most skilled in holding ground within their ever-changing environment.  When the enemy advances on the left flank, the defending force is able to reposition and repel the enemy.  They know the chain of events so well and move with such synchronization that they need only a hint of their enemy’s intent to create an impenetrable blockade.*

**Reverence for our past revitalizes our future.**

The history of our style is an incredible journey.  Over 300 years ago in Shanxi, China, Wong Long was born.  From his life forward, praying mantis style made its way through the Shaolin temple, traveled south by warriors in the protection service, gained reknown and reverence from other styles, banded with masters to form the Jing Wu,  traversed the sea, and survived war, poverty, and famine.  This history, the skills we develop, the knowledge we gain, and the storied legends are all products passed down to each generation.  

You are the current generation. You’ve taken up the mantle to receive the style of 7-Star Praying Mantis.  You are part of this story now.  

Revere your history.  Be inspired by the challenges endured by those before you.  Be grateful for the obstacles overcome to pass the style to the next generation.  Our style is precious and rare.  It is your enthusiasm that breathes life into future generations.

What excites you about Kung Fu?  What drives you to want to train?  How can you share your enthusiasm with others?

# 穩沉 Wán, Chàm
## The Stable.  The Sinking.  The Weighted.

Wán is the quality of stability itself.  It is the foundation upon which we build techniques and develop power.  If not properly established, Wán will be weak, and our techniques will be unstable.  Yet when established with strong root, strength will flow.

Chàm is the action of sinking.  While heaviness is akin to dead weight, sinking is active.  Pushing against the ground as though you were trying to stand, yet lowering your center as though you were trying to sit, Chàm is found through this equilibrium of dynamic tension.  Through Chàm we remain agile, establish Gān and attain Wán.

*Discipline is the foundation for all soldiers.  Yet instilling discipline is an art in and of itself.  Too harsh, the men may become apathetic.  Too easy-going, they may become lethargic and unpredictable.  A tight balance of strictness and leniency will deliver a strong, stable foundation.*

**“Aggression and ego serve only to limit me, so I strive to be humble and respectful.”**

To be humble.  To show humility.  These are qualities that reflect our character as one who is modest.  Such a person does not laud their own achievements, flaunt their status, or boast of their superiority even if they hold merit.  However, such a person neither conceals their achievements nor subjugates themselves to the whims of fate.

So be excited about your achievements, proud of that which you merit, and defend that which needs order - but also be attentive toward self-reflection.  You must be mindful of the impression you give others and focused on instilling discipline upon your own ego.

Do you consider yourself to be humble?
Ask a friend who knows you well of a time you were humble or modest.  Tell us that story.

# 靈輕 Lèng, Hēng
## The Agile.  The Lightened.  The Unrestricted.

Hēng is the concept of lightness, which gives way to Lèng, the quality of being agile.  

To be light means to be nimble.  This is different from floating, which is empty, scattered, and lacks the precision needed for agility.  So when the situation demands Lèng, become light.  Move with exacting precision.

*The time to break camp has come.  Forces must move lest they be overtaken.  If they’ve grown sedentary or complacent then it is already too late.  They must remain alert in order to move swiftly - but if they lack readiness and depart camp without their weapons, their movement will be in vain and merely delay an inevitable defeat.*

**Strength & Clarity**

Learning can be tumultuous at times.  We try our hardest to soak up information and put it to use, yet we still can’t help feel that something is missing.  Maybe it’s our inability to make something effective or bring a seemingly simple concept into reality.  Whatever it is, it limits our understanding.  So we focus on what we lack, seeking to fill the void but also not knowing how.  This leads to frustration, uncertainty, and can even cause us to feel defeated.

Why is this?  What keeps us from figuring things out?  Simple. Ourselves.

When we center our thoughts on what we lack, we inadvertently focus on emotions of weakness and confusion.  So rather than trying to fill that void, center your thoughts on areas you know well, areas with an established understanding and practice.  Then your focus will be on emotions of strength and clarity, and development built on these traits is bound for success.

Write about an area unrelated to kung fu that you are strong in, understand extremely well, and have a clear path to improve even more.
