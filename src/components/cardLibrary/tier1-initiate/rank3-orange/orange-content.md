## The Plucking.  The Strategic.  The Pervasive.

Choi is the concept of extending an opponent’s energy beyond its intended path.

*When the larger warrior can easily overpower the smaller warrior, the smaller one must bide his time and survive until the opportune moment. When the larger warrior’s energy is overextended and at the edge of balance, the smaller warrior can utilize Choi to stagger his opponent and create an opportunity to conquer.*

**“I accept the challenges of my training, and diligently pursue improvement and excellence.”**

The nature of kung fu is inexhaustible.  While the lessons may change or the techniques alter, the essence of kung fu - of knowledge and skill gained through hard work - is eternal.  Pursuit of excellence is a redeeming quality, but you must take care to avoid the pitfalls.  When you doubt your techniques’ effectiveness or believe them to be incomplete, you create a barrier, preventing your own progress.  This lesson applies to all things.  Deny the very nature of the world and you’ll only succeed in limiting what it can offer.
 
You will encounter times where it feels like what you’ve learned just isn’t working.  Do you keep trying to make it work or do you abandon what you’ve learned?  

Consider your answer and explain why you chose one over the other.

# 貼靠 Tip, Kaau
## The Bonded.  The Controlling.  The Connected.

Tip is the concept of connecting the body to the opponent in such a way that one is positioned to control the opponent’s center.  

Kaau is the concept of using your own center for strength to move the body of an opponent.  

*Raw strength is capable of moving a larger person’s body, but only at the expense of tremendous energy loss.  A weaker force cannot afford this loss.  Instead, it seeks a position from which it can multiply its force through leverage.  The weaker force must also maximize their own strength, and when combined with the leverage gained from proper positioning, their attack becomes formidable.*

**The journey you’ve set upon, and the path on which you walk.**

When setting out to explore an unknown world, there is uncertainty about what you’ll encounter.  It is reasonable to expect those encounters to present you with unique challenges, and each challenge to shape who you are, what you know, and what you can do.  These changes refine us and give us purpose.  

The kung fu journey is one of exploring an unknown world.  We strive to meet the challenges in our path, that the experience may shape us and alter our course.  As a result, we continually find new and exciting encounters throughout our journey, and that gives way to passion for our art.
 
What are some of the new and exciting things you’ve encountered along your journey?  How did they shape you?  How did they alter your path?
