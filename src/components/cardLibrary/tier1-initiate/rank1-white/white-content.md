# 挑 Tiu
## The Warding.  The Brushing.  The Evasive.

Tiu is one of the two most fundamental defensive principles.  A full range defensive skill, Tiu is a vital implement to the Mantis practitioner.  In close proximity it wipes down the arm, clearing away an opponent's control or intercepting their advance.

At longer ranges it becomes the first point of contact and gains crucial information.  It gauges the opponent's intent.  It monitors and meters their speed and trajectory.  At its core, Tiu encompasses all defensive techniques that ward away, upward and outward.

*Strategy and tactics.  Surprise and deception.  There are many tools the smaller force must employ to overcome the larger force - but none are as vital as the basics.  Defense against assault, escape from suppression, and maneuvers to intercept share the same foundation.  All that is built will only ever be as strong as this.*

**"I accept the challenges of my training, and diligently pursue improvement and excellence."**

Effort is the essence of Kung Fu.  Your training will be full of challenges, but it will be your effort that determines how you improve.  If you are unable to commit yourself and accept these challenges your effort will be self-defeating.  Don't focus on difficulty or thoughts of what you cannot do.  Rather, embrace the understanding that - with effort - you'll overcome any challenge.

In Kung Fu or in life, what are some of your challenges?  How much effort do you apply to overcome them?  Is your effort sufficient to achieve success?

# 捶三手 Chèui Saam Sáu
## The Three Hands.  The Continuous.  The Flowing.

Chèui Saam Sáu is the concept of continuity.  Known as the “three hands of the mantis,” this relentless attack causes an opponent to perceive more than two hands at work.  Speed is unlocked when motion flows uninterrupted through chained techniques.  This skill allows energy to be conserved and the opponent to lose track of your attacks, lose the beat, and lose the fight.

*The smaller force must always remain active and in motion.  Should this motion be halted, the smaller force must be motivated back into action.  Any territory gained will be lost should the enemy use this moment as an opportunity to attack.*

**“When the student is ready, the master will appear.”**

To be eager and inquisitive is the nature of the inexperienced. For those who seek to be taught, there is no fault in this.  However, it is not the role of the teacher to offer their teachings and seek acceptance from the student.  A student must demonstrate they are receptive to being taught.  This means the student must be modest and humble, accepting their teacher as the source of truth - with faith that their teacher knows the best methods to impart knowledge and skill upon the student.  

Thus in your kung fu training, it is the Sifu that awaits their students’ development, keenly observing their progress and watching for the time when they are ready.

What do you need to do to show that you are ready?  If you feel you are ready, what do you do if your Sifu does not agree?
