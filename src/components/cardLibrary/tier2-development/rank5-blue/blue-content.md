# 閃 Sim, Jau
## The Dodging.  The Stalking.  The Elusive.

Sim is the concept of repositioning, both to yield and to change the angle of approach.

Jau is the concept of circle walking.  Like a tiger stalking its prey, Jau Bou allows you to confuse your opponent and create motion before engagement. 

*Mobility is the key to victory for a smaller force.  They must always keep moving - shifting position, changing direction, being unpredictable.  The importance of this is obvious once engaged, but the importance is greatest before engagement.  If the smaller force is taken by surprise then they will likely suffer defeat.*

**Revisiting that which we’ve neglected.**

A great wealth of knowledge has been imparted upon you in a short amount of time.  With so much to work toward, it is easy to neglect some things in favor of others.  It is important to revisit past teachings and assert effort that your skills may progress rather than spoil.  When you can’t determine where to start, always return to the core, the basics, the foundation.  If these things spoil, everything you’ve built upon them degrades as well.
 
Give an example of something you’ve neglected in your training and another separate from your training.  

How will you revisit these goals and cause them to progress?

# 騰挪 Tàng Nō
## The Elastic.  The Hidden.  The False.

Tàng Nō is the concept of elastic footwork.  Unlike Sim, which repositions through deliberate shift and yield, Tàng Nō repositions along the lower gate through an imperceptible spring-like bounce - often accompanied by hidden attacks from the legs.

*If the larger force is preoccupied, the strategist may be able to insert a specialist behind enemy lines.  A quick and powerful attack could significantly disrupt the larger force, paving a way to victory.*

**Our devotion and our bonds.**

We all walk in different circles.  Maintaining the strength of affinity within those circles is limited by devotion to the central, shared idea that binds them.  There is a unique strength in union of the many.  It lifts our spirits, encourages us to action, and restores engagement when personal motivation falters.  

Devotion is the quality required for such fellowship to manifest.  Nothing is forced, but should you offer devotion to the central figure, be it a cause, a leader, a team, or even a goal, you will receive the intrinsic rewards that come from those bonds.

In kung fu, where do you place your devotion?  How does this impact the bond between your kung fu brothers, sisters,  teachers, and yourself?

# 敏感 Mán Gám
## The Sensitive.  The Spatial.  The Predictive.

Mán Gám is the concept of sensitivity or spatial contextual awareness.  It is the ability to leverage information obtained from Jim and Nim, interpreted through a body which is Sūng.  This perceptive analysis and an understanding of mobility give way to total knowledge of your opponent’s current and future position.  All this is achieved without the need for eyesight, for awareness solely derived from vision cannot be transformed quick enough to action.

*The strategist uses the tools at his disposal to predict the enemy’s next move.  He must leverage the spy who informs him, the tactics to predict their response, and his own knowledge of warfare.  When the tools are well honed, they allow the strategist to devise plans that will ensure victory.*

**The Nature of Refinement**

There is a sort of elegance to polishing that which is rough, but the path chosen will determine the brilliance that can be achieved.  One path may get you there quicker, like a varnish applied to a stone.  The luster is visible - but the keen eye knows it is superficial and will wear down if put to task.  The other path requires taking time to work out each imperfection with methodical and consistent practice.  A longer journey for sure, but one that demonstrates a willingness to confront  the many challenges of development.  Here the luster would be true.

So if you aim for lasting success, then you must recognize that true refinement goes deeper than the surface, both in application and action.

Choose a form and practice it slowly.  As you practice, identify two minor details that are not perfect (Hint: “Stances are too high” is NOT a minor detail).  Really spend time to think about something small.  Once you have them, describe them.  Include what they should ideally look like, what you are doing now that needs correction, and how you will make it happen.

# 嶗山林 Lòu Sāan Làm
## The Forests of Laoshan

Many years after Wong Long passed, the doctor Sam Sīu Dou Yàn visited a temple in Laoshan where Praying Mantis had been preserved for generations. 
Upon seeing their curious techniques, he challenged the monks to fight - and lost.

Sam Sīu Dou Yàn quickly sought an audience with the abbot and was granted permission to train the secret style.
