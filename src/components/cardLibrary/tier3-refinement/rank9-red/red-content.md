# 門 Gates
## The Entry.  The Opportunity.  The Abyss.

The gates are a concept that breaks down the positioning of the body.  The two most basic of them are the inside & outside gate.  

The inside gate is the area between the arms & legs and is home to our vital organs.  

The outside gate is the area outside the arms & legs.  

*Be wary of the opponent who approaches your home, for even while they remain outside their attacks may penetrate your walls.  Be more wary of the opponent who enters your home unannounced, for they are reckless and lack caution.  Be most wary of opponents who invite you into their home without fear.*

**“Through Confidence, Courage, and Conviction, I will Persevere and I will Succeed.”**

Success is gained through progress.  To advance down a path you must demonstrate perseverance, the will to push onward.  Your willpower will be strengthened as you raise your confidence and gain the courage to face failure.  Lastly, you must find and bolster your conviction, the will to achieve success.  

The path is long and arduous.  There will be times of standstill where it seems that you’ve reached the end of your rope.  But should you demonstrate patience, focus on these tenets, and continue looking forward, then progress will surely follow.

# 鬆 Sūng
## The Relaxed.  The Unimpeded.  The Soft.

Sung is the concept of being void of tension such that energy may flow uninterrupted.  It is a state of relaxation where there is no tension, yet the body may still move however it desires.

*If a smaller force acts bullish and aggressively resists opposition, they unknowingly blind themselves to flanks.  Likewise, if they yield to every advance they quickly run out of room to maneuver and are overrun.  Success is found through resistance while yielding.*

**“The skills I learn are my own, and I shall use them only in defense of myself and others.”**

Through strength and steadfastness we are able to learn many skills, and we prepare to use these skills in the defense of others.  But this idea has multiple meanings.  Fighting to protect the defenseless typically comes to mind, though some learn forms like a collector, hoarding knowledge.  While we do claim these skills as our own, following the path for this purpose may bring misfortune.

By sharing knowledge to educate and improve others, we enable them to defend themselves.  Such kindness toward our  classmates aids them on their path to improvement, and moves us further along our own.

How do you aid your fellow classmates?  Do you help motivate them?  Do you cheer them on and encourage them?  What new things can you do to help your classmates grow with you?

# 撲摟封 Pok, Lāu, Fūng
## The Closing.  The Secured.  The Sealing.

Pok is the concept of warding inwardly, typically with the palm of the hand.  The hand moves across the body using the power of a connected waist, closing the inner gate.  Be careful not to overextend or unnecessarily redirect as both are common faults.

Lāu is the concept of securing one’s hand to an opponent.  Initiated with Pok, it is then altered to create a tight grasp using the strength of the fingers.  This allows the wrist to remain flexible.

Fūng is the concept of sealing.  Also initiated with Pok and often performed in combination with Lau, the opponent’s limb is trapped below the gate being attacked.

*A strategy to divide the enemy forces can be quite effective.  But if you do not ensure that the divided force is secured or sealed off, they will rejoin the main force before you can exploit this advantage.*

**The Importance of Family**

Family is the basis for most relationships.  Love, loyalty, respect, devotion - this wide array of relationship qualities is best depicted through a familial structure.  Spousal, sibling, parental, and filial relationships are all different, and though the strength of our bonds vary, these types of relationships are the cornerstone for all others.

A familial hierarchy exists in Chinese martial arts culture, which is one of student & master.  The Sifu is head of the household, exhibiting love and devotion to his students.  They reciprocate through loyalty and devotion of their own.  Students show each other respect and humble themselves to their elders, as siblings would.  The strength of these bonds are what you make of them, but know that strong bonds beget unity, which earns you a collective strength that is unattainable alone.

Describe your relationships with your Kung Fu family.  Think of how people have been supportive of you or how you’ve aided other fellow students.  Think of the bonds you share with your instructors and your Sifu.
