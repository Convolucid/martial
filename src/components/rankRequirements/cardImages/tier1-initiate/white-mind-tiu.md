# Tiu
## The Warding.  The Brushing.  The Evasive.

Tiu is one of the two most fundamental defensive principles.  A full range defensive skill, Tiu is a vital implement to the Mantis practitioner.  In close proximity it wipes down the arm, clearing away an opponent's control or intercepting their advance.

At longer ranges it becomes the first point of contact and gains crucial information.  It gauges the opponent's intent.  It monitors and meters their speed and trajectory.  At its core, Tiu encompasses all defensive techniques that ward away, upward and outward.

**Strategy and tactics.  Surprise and deception.  There are many tools the smaller force must employ to overcome the larger force - but none are as vital as the basics.  Defense against assault, escape from suppression, and maneuvers to intercept share the same foundation.  All that is built will only ever be as strong as this.**

## Assignment

> "I accept the challenges of my training, and diligently pursue improvement and excellence."

Effort is the essence of Kung Fu.  Your training will be full of challenges, but it will be your effort that determines how you improve.  If you are unable to commit yourself and accept these challenges your effort will be self-defeating.  Don't focus on difficulty or thoughts of what you cannot do.  Rather, embrace the understanding that - with effort - you'll overcome any challenge.

In Kung Fu or in life, what are some of your challenges?  How much effort do you apply to overcome them?  Is your effort sufficient to achieve success?
