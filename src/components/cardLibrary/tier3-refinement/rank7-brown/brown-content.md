# 八打 Baat Dā
## The Focused.  The Accurate.  The Precise.

The 8 Points of Weakening are targeting concepts that a practioner should use in their fighting.  They represent points that weaken the opponent by disrupting the meridians and flow of chi.  These points are:

Centerline - Between the Eyes
Centerline - Upper Lip
Off Center - Cheekbone/Jaw Joint
Off Center - Clavicle
Off Center - Floating Rib
Centerline - Dan Tien / Pubic Bone
Limbs - Joints (Knee/Elbow)
Centerline - Spine

*Brute force attacks only wear out your men and earn you a battle of attrition.  Far better to leverage the tactician’s skill and surgically target the opposing force’s weak points.  This allows a smaller force to fight within their capacity - a battle of attrition would signal an imminent defeat.*

**“Through Confidence, Courage, and Conviction, I will Persevere and I will Succeed.”**

The first step of any journey is often mapping out the road ahead.  This alone is fraught with challenges and obstacles - if you don’t know where you’re going, how can you define the path?  With confidence, you overcome these challenges and surpass these obstacles.  The path emerges into clear view.  The journey is born.

It is perseverance that allows you to arrive at this point, where the road before you has substance, structure, and clear direction.   With that, the first steps of your journey have already found success.  No harm comes from enjoying this victory, but don’t linger - the true journey is about to begin.

You’ve built a foundation and are on the path to refining those skills.  What are the top 3 areas you hope to refine throughout this chamber?  

How will you go about progressing through these areas?  

When do you plan to achieve success?

**Be Attentive Toward the Time of Refinement**

When we do things long enough, our space gradually becomes full.  To continue progressing we must make a decision: Refine or Dispose?

If we do not decide, nature ensures there will be loss.  If we choose to dispose, we may feel there is no longer merit in maintaining what we’ve built.  This can be a dangerous decision, for without proper guidance how are we to be sure that it’s run its course?  

If we choose to refine, then we have seized opportunity.  We may unlock previously hidden areas, only revealed once we’ve obtained the sufficient expertise.  Thus it is wise to return and revisit that which is old to find that which is new.

What areas of your training do you want to revisit?
What is your plan to refine past skills & teachings?

# 四外練 Sei Ngoi Lin

**Drawing Strength from That Which is Lacking**

The longer you advance down any path, the more you may recognize a decrease in development.  You may even find that you need to return to simple matters long surpassed.  In such times you need not concern yourself with the change in development, but revel in the opportunity to refine oneself. Build a new platform for the next stage of growth.  If you deny yourself this opportunity and instead charge forth, you’ll only find that what you lack has compounded.  The flaws become more significant the farther you travel.  

Have you experienced a decrease in your learning?  What positive effect can you work on as it relates to this decrease?

**Refinement Through Adversity**

The farther we travel down any path, the more significant the obstacles.  They appear more frequently and are often more challenging than those encountered in the past.  Such obstacles are the nature of refinement.  In many cases, these are the very same obstacles we avoided during our stages of development, when we lacked the wherewithal to conquer them.  

But now, equipped with the tools gained from development, we can overcome the obstacles that once stood in our way.  By clearing the path already traveled, we elevate our strength and clarity - and we may uncover new branches of development  hidden behind the very challenges we avoided. 

Describe 3 obstacles that you encountered in the past and how you are now ready to overcome them.
Be prepared to explain these obstacles and show your success to Sifu at your next test.

# 不即不離 Bāt Jīk Bāt Lèi
## The Experienced.  The Prepared.  The Tactician.

Bāt Jīk Bāt Lèi is the concept of engagement distance: not too close, not too far.  Distance is about timing and opportunity.  Too close without regard for timing and you’ll obstruct your own attacks and diminish your maneuverability. Too far and you’re unable to capitalize when your opponent overextends.  You must learn your opponent’s reach, their extension of energy, and your own execution range.  These factors define your window for engagement.

*The greatest tacticians understand the power of properly gauging distance.  Knowledge of an opposing action and the corresponding timing and distance of that action offers even the smallest forces an uncanny advantage.*

**The Power of Limitations**

Rule & law create a framework that spurs the world to order.  These limitations are levied upon us in a large sense by nature and society, over which we have limited control.  However, on a smaller scale, we set limitations upon ourselves.  In some ways those limitations must be broken through to further growth.  

Still, there are some self-imposed limitations to which we hold because they give direction and purpose.  We impose many such limits in Kung Fu.  The ritual requirement of a salute and bow strengthens our focus and builds humble, respectful qualities.  The time required between advancements drives us to further refine what we already have.  There is power in the limitations we impose on ourselves and we should not overlook their purpose.  Instead we should be vigilant for the need to establish new limits.

Create a limitation and make a commitment to use it for self-improvement.  Describe this limitation, why you chose it, and how you expect it will aid your growth.  Be prepared to discuss this limit at your next test.

# 玉皇廟 Yuk Wòng Miu
## The Jade Emperor Temple

Wòng Wìng Sāang was a wealthy Sifu at the Jade Emperor Temple in Yantai.  One day, famed Mantis master Léi Sāam Jín arrived and criticized Wòng’s skill.  Wòng attacked, but his strikes found only air.  Humbled, Wòng Wìng Sāang requested to study under Léi.

The resulting iteration of Mantis is widely regarded as the birth of the Seven Star style.
