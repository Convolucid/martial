# 不丟不頂 Bāt Dīu Bāt Déng
## The Latching.  The Ever-present.  The Unrestricted.

Bāt Dīu Bāt Déng is a duality principle which states that losing contact is incorrect, yet resisting is also incorrect.  Thus the proper method is to both maintain contact and not resist.  This principle expands our understanding of Jim & Nim.  We must seek to maintain contact once it has been established, but the way we achieve this matters as well.  To resist the natural flow of things in order to avoid loss is self-defeating, but so too would it be if we simply submit. 

*A battle of attrition is the fool’s strategy.  The dominant force is likely to overcome, and even if the smaller force were to succeed their losses would be great.  Some battles must be lost, but if ground is taken too easily then it may alert the opposition to a greater strategy at work.*

**The Strength of Our Resolve.**

When you are traveling down a path, it is your determination that keeps you steady.  Each person’s determination manifests differently but the result is the same.  The challenge lies in the obstacles standing in the way of our determination.  It is the strength of our resolve which allows our determination to stand firm.

The path of the martial artist is fraught with these obstacles.  But it is the accomplishment of overcoming that makes it all worthwhile.  So regardless of your reasons for training, it is resolve that ensures we may break through and continue to progress.

What motivates and inspires you to train? How strong do you gauge your resolve to progress your training?
Name an obstacle which your resolve is not strong enough to overcome.

# 引進落空 Yán Jeun Laai Hūng
## The Trickster.  The Enthralling.  The Ruse.

Yán Jeun Laai Hūng is the concept of attracting into emptiness.  It is the idea that your opponent will not haphazardly stumble into a trap without bait.  You must allow them to trust their attack will land but prepare a precisely timed yield - thereby revealing their error only after the trap has been sprung.  This level of deception will grant you significant gains if performed well.

*The enemy strategist is well aware of the typical ploys and is therefore cautious.  If the ambush you’ve set is too obvious, the opposing force will simply retreat and you will have gained nothing.  Lure the enemy with an object of desire nearly within their reach.  They will overextend in their ambition and your ambush will succeed.*

**水滴石穿 - Dripping Water Penetrates the Stone**

In a time of progress, perseverance is key to achieving our goals.  But we must remain cautious.  Attempts to move too quickly can inadvertently halt progress.  It is through patience that we unlock the true strength of perseverance.  

Even when we cannot see the path forward we will find success by demonstrating patience.  Like small amounts of water dripping onto the surface of a stone, we must maintain consistent effort even as we’re blind to the results.  Through this practice we find success - just as we would eventually discover that the water has bore through the stone.

# 方圓 Fōng Yùn
## The Firm.  The Lithe.  The Complementary.

Fōng is the concept of squareness.  That which is square has a solid foundation and impeccable balance.  Such a construct is strong, powerful, and finite, allowing energy to be backed by the ground on which the foundation was laid.

Yùn is the concept of roundness.  That which is round is perfectly flexible and ever-changing.  Such a construct is fast, fluid, and infinite, allowing energy to transfer and adapt to new vectors.

Success is found when Fōng is within Yùn, and when Yùn is within Fōng.

*Should the opposing general field only cavalry, they’ll have an edge in mobility but lack in power.  Likewise, if the general were to field only artillery, they would have an edge in power but lack mobility.  Therefore it is reasonable to expect that we’ll encounter a balance of both.*

**The Importance of Minor Refinement**

Refinement and effectiveness have an exponential relationship.  At 100%, you’ve refined yourself to perfection and your effectiveness will likewise be perfect.  However, refine yourself to 99% and your effectiveness will top out at 80%.  Every minor blemish you polish makes the whole shine so much brighter.  

Refinement happens in stages.  It is only after you reach 100% that you discover you’re truthfully still at 98% - and with that discovery, you can access the next level of refinement.

There is so much to be gained by focusing on minor refinement that you should actively set goals to improve minor details.  What are some of the smallest details you can think of that you’d like to add some polish to?  Set goals for working on these and describe why these details are important.  Be prepared to explain and demonstrate your success to Sifu at your next test.

# 四两撥千斤 Sei Léung But Chīn Gān
## The Ultimate.  The Keen.  The Mighty.

Sei Léung But Chīn Gān is the proverb “Four Ounces Can Overcome 1000 Pounds.”  This concept illustrates the scale to which efficiency yields effectiveness.  When all conditions are met, it takes little effort to topple that which is great.  Beyond simple technique, this concept extends to all aspects of Kung Fu as well as life.  It is the embodiment of the inferior man who has laid the groundwork to conquer what appears insurmountable: rising up to become superior.

*We have cut off their supply routes, allied with their enemies, and exploited every weakness we could find.  Head-to-head we would have been routed quickly, but now that these conditions have been met, we merely need to pull on the thread to watch it all unravel before us.*

**大勇若怯 - A Great Hero May Appear Timid**
**Balancing Success with Modesty**

Success begets success, and consecutive successes are a breeding ground for arrogance.  As our knowledge expands and our skills improve we may find we’ve inadvertently placed ourselves on a pedestal, explicitly situating ourselves above others.  

Likewise, it would be arrogant to presume that we’d never do such a thing.  It is within our nature to revel in success.  We tend to enjoy the empowerment over those walking a path we’ve already traversed.  The constant pursuit of modesty tempers this natural inclination.  Through modesty our upward push can continue unhindered, because we keep our minds and hearts open to the notion that each success is not ours alone - and neither are they indicative of an eternal greatness.  And so we shift our focus from the success itself and onto bringing others to a similar attainment.

Write a short story of a time when success had gone to your head.  What was it that humbled you to realize where you had gone wrong?  Looking back, what would have been the modest approach to prevent it from happening?

# 小敵大慢敵快 Síu Dik Daai, Maan Dik Faai
## The Unimposing.  The Proficient.  The Imperceptible.

Síu Dik Daai is the concept of the small overcoming the large, while Maan Dik Faai is the concept of the slow overcoming the swift. This pairing of concepts indicates that by combining the proper technique with the patience to execute it at the right time, one may become superior to those who dwell in excess.

*If we take a smaller force with knowledge of the terrain and skill in ambush tactics, it becomes quite possible to decimate larger forces.  Still, such a force requires heavy training to be succesful.*

**Navigating a Time When the Waters Flood**

Despite your best efforts, there comes a time when the waters flood and you are overloaded with too much of a good thing.  Perhaps it is because you didn’t leverage a time of decrease, overcome past obstacles, or set limits upon yourself to be better prepared.  Regardless, the “why” will only give insight for how to avoid this culmination in the future.  Now that it is here you should make the most of it.  

Unlike being overloaded with burdens, being overloaded by blessings can still be beneficial if properly navigated.  It is very enticing to lose yourself in all the great things happening, but if you ignore caution and vigilance you’ll have a hard time noticing a turn for the worse.  You must be decisive and take action to reduce that which overwhelms you.  If you proceed in this fashion you’ll be ready to pivot when times shift yet again.

Write a short story of a time when you encountered too much of a good thing.  How did you navigate those waters?  Was it difficult to handle?  How do you think you could’ve handled it now that you look back?

# 螳螂出洞拳 Tòng Lòng Chèut Dung Kyùn
## Praying Mantis Exits the Cave

Its name does it justice - the Mantis practitioner bursts forth from secluded study with fantastical technique chains and deceptively erratic footwork, leveraging a strong comprehensive set of Mantis movements.

# 山東鄉 Sāan Dūng Heung
## The Shandong Countryside

Faan Yūk Dūng, also known as “the Giant with the Broadsword,” was an extraordinary student of Wòng Wìng Sāang. 

The inheritor of Seven Star, he was a fighter of incredible size and skill.  Legends describe him wandering the countryside when two raging bulls charged.  One fell to a mighty kick.  The other met Faan Yūk Dūng’s Iron Palm technique with its skull.
