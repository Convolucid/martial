# 捶三手 Au, Diu, Got
## The Mantis Hook.  The Intercepting.  The Illusive.

Au is the concept of a wrapped hand latching onto an opponent.  When Au is formed, it will neither squeeze and tighten nor relax and loosen.  

Diu is the concept of implementing Au to intercept incoming attacks.  Like using a banister when ascending a staircase, Diu applies Au in a straight line.  In some applications Diu also has the ability to lock itself in place.  

Got is the concept of implementing Au in a cross-cutting motion.  This allows the practitioner to open the opponent’s gate wider or even change it entirely.

*For a smaller force to take on a larger force, unconventional means are necessary.  The day is won by leveraging mobility rather than might.  Stay in one place for too long and the opponent will learn how to deal with you.  Better to remain elusive and always moving.*

**“The skills I learn are my own, and I shall use them only in defense of myself and others.”**

Knowledge is imparted to us.  Ability is trained in us.  But everything gained comes by our own efforts.  Understanding, efficiency, effectiveness, and excellence are all qualities earned through effort, which is owned by you and no other.  You must hold yourself accountable for the skills you’ve learned.  They’re honed through your effort - and you bear the responsibility for how they’re put to use.
 
The skills you learn may be yours, but that’s not to say you shouldn’t share.  How can you aid your fellow students with the skills you’re developing?

# 粘黏 Jim, Nim
## The Conduit. The Adhering. The Unrelenting.

Jim is the concept of establishing physical contact with an opponent such that the connection seems to stick and cannot come apart.  

Nim is the concept of maintaining the connection created by Jim.  Nim follows all movement as though it was permanently stuck to the opponent.

*Information is key for a strategist to develop a plan to overcome his opponent.  He must place a spy in the enemies’ ranks if he seeks to understand them.  By doing so, he learns their patterns and intentions before they happen, so that the necessary countermeasures may be prepared.*

**“I realize aggression and ego serve only to limit me, so I strive to be humble and respectful.”**

Often, one cannot see the forest for the trees.  This truth is the effect of being short sighted, an affliction caused by aggression and ego.  Aggression is demonstrated when you push forth, oblivious to the possible outcomes.  Ego is revealed when you learn the outcomes and assume they don’t apply to you.  Be mindful of these traits.  Misfortune awaits those who close their mind in ignorance, but a closed mind can be opened by demonstrating humility and respect.
 
At times we are reckless and do not realize it until later.  Describe a time your ego got the best of you and - in hindsight - what you would have changed.
